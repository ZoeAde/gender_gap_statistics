                <p><i>Defining the Gender Gap<i> is a project resulting from a screening of <i>“Code: Debugging the Gender Gap”<i> by Robin Hauser Reynolds. As a junior full-stack  developer, I was astounded and the shear lack of diversity in the tech community. Women are simply not represented as they should be. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Among those interviewed in the documentary is Tracy Chou, a software engineer at Pinterest. While she heard of this gender gap, there is was little data displaying the facts, so Tracey wrote an <a href="https://medium.com/@triketora/where-are-the-numbers-cb997a57252">article</a> and asked companies to voluntarily submit their total number of female engineers. The data on this site is a reflection of her findings, as reported on a simple <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlZH8QBl60oodEJTdFA5TlZOcDJCMU02RkZoSHF5SHc#gid=0">google spreadsheet</a>.  By visualizing these staggering numbers, I hope to further convey the lack of representation by females in the tech industry. Through awareness comes change, which is both long overdue and necessary. </p>
                <br>
                <p>A big thank you to both Robin Hauser Reynolds and Tracey Chou, without whom my own understanding of the separation in engineering jobs would still be lacking.</p>
