                <p>This site is the result of a screening of <i>“Code: Debugging the Gender Gap”</i>, a documentary by Robin Hauser Reynolds which sheds light on the lack of gender diversity in the tech community. As a junior full-stack  developer, I was astounded and the shear lack of female representation in my community, as well as the cultural norms that have allowed for it. Women are simply not represented as they should be. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Among those interviewed in the documentary is <a href="https://github.com/triketora">Tracy Chou</a>, a software engineer at Pinterest. While she heard of this gender gap, there is was little data displaying the facts, so Tracey wrote an <a href="https://medium.com/@triketora/where-are-the-numbers-cb997a57252">article</a> and asked companies to voluntarily submit their total number of female engineers. The data on this site is a reflection of her findings, as reported on a simple google <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlZH8QBl60oodEJTdFA5TlZOcDJCMU02RkZoSHF5SHc#gid=0">spreadsheet</a>.  By visualizing these staggering numbers, I hope to further convey the lack of representation by females in the tech industry. Through awareness comes change, which is both long overdue and necessary. </p>
                <br>
                <p>A big thank you to both Robin Hauser Reynolds and Tracey Chou, without whom my own awareness of the separation in engineering jobs would still be lacking.</p>
